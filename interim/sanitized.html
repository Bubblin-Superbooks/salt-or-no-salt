<p>AMERICA’S NEW TABLE SEASONING</p>
<p>A new trend in food and nutrition is the fast-increasing use of fresh lemon juice as an all-purpose table seasoning. Fresh lemons have long been recognized as an indispensable flavoring for pies, tomato juice, tea, fish and seafood. Now millions are discovering that a squeeze of fresh lemon improves a long list of foods.</p>
<p>This new seasoning idea started with the thousands of people on low-salt and reducing diets. The <em>real</em> problem of these diets was to find some table seasoning to compensate for the loss of salt. Fresh lemons with their tantalizing tang and aromatic flavor are a wonderful help, patients report.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to be on a special diet to enjoy the wonderful lift lemons give to food flavors. Soups, salads, meats, vegetables—_in fact, practically all foods_—are made instantly more flavorful, more delicious with a good squeeze of fresh lemon added at the table.</p>
<p>A SQUEEZE OF LEMON ...</p>
<p>Whether or <em>not</em> you salt your food, try adding the tang and aroma of fresh lemon juice. You know what lemons do for fish and seafood, tomato juice and tea. Now see what appetizing zest and sparkle they add to the many foods illustrated on this page.</p>

<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/salt-or-no-salt/master/assets/images/p2c.jpg" alt="Dessert servings">
<p>Easiest and quickest desserts for dieters are those made of fresh fruits—and there’s a trick to varying these too:</p>
<p>Try a squeeze of lemon on cantaloupe or muskmelon to bring out the delicate flavor.</p>
<p>Sliced fresh peaches, sprinkled with lemon juice and then sweetened with sugar, are delicious.</p>
<p>If you sprinkle sliced bananas with lemon juice, then sweeten with honey, you’ll have a pleasant taste surprise. Add color and texture contrast with juicy orange chunks.</p>
<h3>FISH</h3>


<img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/salt-or-no-salt/master/assets/images/p2d.jpg" alt="Fish dish">
<p>Usually, juicy lemon wedges are enough to serve with fish—no other seasonings are necessary. However, for a lively flavor, fish may be sprinkled with lemon juice and paprika before broiling.</p>
<p>To eliminate odor, rub fish inside and out with fresh lemon before cooking. Adds flavor.</p>
<h3>VEGETABLES</h3>
